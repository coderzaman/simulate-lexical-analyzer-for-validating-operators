# C++ Operator Validator

This C++ program serves as a simple lexical analyzer to determine whether a given string is an operator. The supported categories include arithmetic, relational, assignment, logical, and bitwise operators.

# Usage:
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter an operator when prompted.
4. The program will identify and display the category of the entered operator.

# Code Structure:
- Separate functions (`isArithmetic`, `isRelationalOperators`, `isAssignmentOperators`, `isLogicalOperators`, `isBitwiseOperators`) check if a given string matches any operator in their respective categories.
- User input is collected using `getline` for robust input handling.

# Supported Operators:
- Arithmetic Operators: + - * / %
- Relational Operators: < > <= >= == !=
- Assignment Operators: = += -= *= /= %=
- Logical Operators: && ||
- Bitwise Operators: & | ^

# Note:
The list of operators in the code is abbreviated for brevity. Refer to authoritative sources for the comprehensive list of C++ operators.

# Sample Execution: 
```
Please Enter to check if the given string is an operator or not: &&

Output:
&& is a Logical Operator
```
```
